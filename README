02: ubuntu-mono                  -> Icons used in Ubuntu >= 10.04

Applications

06: lightdm-ubuntu               -> A cross-desktop lightweight display manager
07: accountsservice-ubuntu       -> Daemon to query user account information
08: lightdm-unity-greeter        -> The LightDM greeter for Unity
09: python-defer                 -> A small framework for async. programming
10: ubuntu-tweak                 -> Tweaking tool for Ubuntu (and Arch Linux :D)
11: globalmenu-extension         -> Global menu extensions for FF and TB

All of the PKGBUILD's have been checked with the namcap tool for consistency.

Troubleshooting:

The LightDM Unity Greeter does not show the user's wallpaper.

  This is because the regular accountsservice package does not care about
  the wallpaper being changed. This action is only logged by accountsservice-
  ubuntu, so just change the wallpaper to something else and then back.

Blah feature from Ubuntu Tweak is not working.

  Please file a bug at either (not both):

    github: https://github.com/chenxiaolong/Unity-for-Arch-Extra/issues
    Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/unity-for-arch-extra

  I've had to remove many features in Ubuntu Tweak due them being Ubuntu-
  specific (apt, dpkg, PPAs, etc.). However, Ubuntu Tweak relies on the
  PolicyKit API exposed by the aptdaemon library, rather than the regular
  PolicyKit API. So, no features that require root permissions will work.
