Troubleshooting:

The LightDM Unity Greeter does not show the user's wallpaper.

  This is because the regular accountsservice package does not care about
  the wallpaper being changed. This action is only logged by accountsservice-
  ubuntu, so just change the wallpaper to something else and then back.
