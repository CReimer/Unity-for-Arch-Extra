Troubleshooting:

The LightDM Unity Greeter does not show the user's wallpaper.

  This is because the regular accountsservice package does not care about
  the wallpaper being changed. This action is only logged by accountsservice-
  ubuntu, so just change the wallpaper to something else and then back.

Blah feature from Ubuntu Tweak is not working.

  Please file a bug at either (not both):

    github: https://github.com/chenxiaolong/Unity-for-Arch-Extra/issues
    Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/unity-for-arch-extra

  I've had to remove many features in Ubuntu Tweak due them being Ubuntu-
  specific (apt, dpkg, PPAs, etc.). However, Ubuntu Tweak relies on the
  PolicyKit API exposed by the aptdaemon library, rather than the regular
  PolicyKit API. So, no features that require root permissions will work.

The NetworkManager applet does not show up in LightDM when systemd is used

  This is due to Arch Linux not including pam_systemd.so in the PAM confguration
  files. I'm not exactly sure which PAM configuration file to add it to. It can
  be worked around temporarily by patching the NetworkManager dbus policy. This
  will need to be done every time NetworkManager is updated.

    # patch -Np0 -i ./lightdm-unity-greeter/NetworkManager-dbus.patch

  OR

    $ sudo patch -Np0 -i ./lightdm-unity-greeter/NetworkManager-dbus.patch
