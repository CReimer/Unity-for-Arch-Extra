Troubleshooting:

The LightDM Unity Greeter does not show the user's wallpaper.

  This is because the regular accountsservice package does not care about
  the wallpaper being changed. This action is only logged by accountsservice-
  ubuntu, so just change the wallpaper to something else and then back.

Blah feature from Ubuntu Tweak is not working.

  Please file a bug at either (not both):

    github: https://github.com/chenxiaolong/Unity-for-Arch-Extra/issues
    Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/unity-for-arch-extra

  I've had to remove many features in Ubuntu Tweak due them being Ubuntu-
  specific (apt, dpkg, PPAs, etc.). However, Ubuntu Tweak relies on the
  PolicyKit API exposed by the aptdaemon library, rather than the regular
  PolicyKit API. So, no features that require root permissions will work.
